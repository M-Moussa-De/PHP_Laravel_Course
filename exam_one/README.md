# Exam one

This is the first exam on the course. We should implement a signin and signup pages and to save the data into a local DB (json).

## How to run it

Clone it by run this command `git clone https://github.com/M-Moussa-De/PHP_Laravel_Course/tree/master/exam_one`

Once you have the repo locally, hit to the config file on the root of the exam_one directory and update the `ROOT_PATH` to where you have saved the repo.

On your browser of choice, type the url to the repo path. It'd be something like
`http:localhost:<<repo_path>>`
