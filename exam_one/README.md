# Exam one

This is the first exam on the course. We should implement a signin, signup, products, cart with the CRUD operations and checkout pages and to save the data into a local DB (json).

## How to run it

Clone it by run this command `git clone https://github.com/M-Moussa-De/PHP_Laravel_Course/tree/master/exam_one`

On your browser of choice, type the url to the repo path. It'd be something like `http:localhost:<<repo_path>>`

## Note:

In case you encounter a problem states that the `ROOT_PATH` is undefined, this would be coming from the config page. In this case, optimize the path to your project structure.

If you face any different kind of problems, please write me.
